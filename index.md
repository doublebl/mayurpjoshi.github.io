I am an assistant professor (lecturer) in financial technologies (FinTech) and information systems (IS) at Alliance Manchester Business School, The University of Manchester, UK. I earned my Ph.D. in business administration from Ivey Business School, Western University, Canada. I worked as a banker for several years prior to joining academia, where I was engaged with functions and initiatives such as technology implementation, process improvement, and branch banking operations. I am also affiliated with Scotiabank Digital Banking Lab at Ivey Business School as a research fellow and I serve as an Early Career Board Member at the Journal of Strategic Information Systems.

My research examines the implications of digitalization for the fundamental and emerging processes of organizing by drawing on- and contributing to- organizational theory in the context of financial services and information technology industries. A practitioner version of my recent work on data science and data scientists was published at MIT Sloan Management Review, a chapter is forthcoming in the book The Cambridge Handbook of Qualitative Digital Research, and several other articles are at different stages of the peer-review process at leading academic journals. 

My research has been recognized with awards including Honorary Mention in OT Division at the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada (ASAC), Best Paper in Strategic IT Track & Best Emerging Research Forum (ERF) Paper (runner-up) at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), Best Student Paper at the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) SIGDSA Symposium. I have been honored with publishing an article in MIT Sloan Management Review that featured among the top 10 most popular articles of 2021, and a symposium I organized at the 2022 Academy of Management Annual Meeting was honored as a Showcase Symposium.
